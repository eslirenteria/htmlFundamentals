        Coca-Cola history began in 1886 when the curiosity of an Atlanta pharmacist,
        Dr. John S. Pemberton, led him to create a distinctive tasting soft drink that could be sold at soda fountains.
        <br/>He created a flavored syrup, took it to his neighborhood pharmacy, where it was mixed with carbonated water
        and deemed “excellent” by those who sampled it.
        <p>Dr. Pemberton’s partner and <span class="fact">bookkeeper<span/>, Frank M. Robinson, is credited with naming the beverage “Coca‑Cola” as well as designing the trademarked, distinct script, still used today.</p>
